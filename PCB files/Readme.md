This folder contains data of the custom PCBs used in the project.

PCB files were created with KiCAD 9.0. This folder contains the project 
files of the PCBs required for the robot's mainboard, its DC-DC converters, 
and for the remote control. Note that no symbol or footprint library was 
exported with the projects.

Complete Gerber files are also included in the two archives.
