This folder contains CAD files of the project. 

The assembly files are complete models of the remote control (RC assembly.zip)
and the robot (Assembly.zip).

Printable parts are stored in Printed components (RC).zip (remote control) and
Printed panels.zip and Mounting components.zip (both of the robot). The Mecanum
wheels.zip archive includes print parts as well as CAD models of the bearings and
motors. The Metal and acrylic plates.zip archive includes CAD models of the plates
that need to be machined for HydroBot.
