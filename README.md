HydroBot is a demonstrator platform for fuel cell electric vehicles. The aim of the project was 
to develop a remote-controlled robot that is powered by a hydrogen fuel cell. The power supply 
system was designed analogously to fuel cell cars, with a fuel cell stack and a battery as a 
combined power supply system. The robotic platform uses Mecanum wheels as a drive system, which 
allows it to drive in any direction without requiring a classical steering assembly. 

HydroBot was developed by the [Helmholtz-Institute Erlangen-Nürnberg for Renewable Energies (HI ERN)](https://www.hi-ern.de/en) 
to showcase an application of fuel cells. The idea of the project was to manufacture a prototype 
suitable as a demonstrator for fairs, and to get a glimpse into system integration, which is not 
part of the core competencies of the department that developed HydroBot.
