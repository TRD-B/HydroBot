# HydroBot

HydroBot is a demonstrator platform for fuel cell electric vehicles. It is a remote-controlled robot 
that is primarily powered by a 12.8 V LiFePO4 battery. Additionally, it is equipped with a 60 W fuel 
cell stack and can carry up to 8 g of hydrogen in eight metal-hydride cartridges. The fuel cell is 
used to charge the battery while the robot is operating, which shows the power system of a fuel 
cell electric vehicle: An electric motor is powered from a fuel cell with a buffer battery. Depending 
on the load conditions, the fuel cell directly powers the motors and charges the battery (idle/low 
load), or the motors are powered by the fuel cell as well as the battery (high load). 

This robotic platform uses Mecanum wheels as a drive system. Mecanum wheels allow a vehicle 
to drive in any direction without requiring a classical steering assembly. The wheels consist of 
freely spinning rollers acting as wheel treads that are oriented at 45Â° relative to the axis. They work 
by selectively adjusting the rotation speed and direction for all four wheels, and therefore, require 
independent motors and drive trains for each wheel.  

This repository contains detailed data and information on the project, such as its user manual, 
datasheets of its components, files for custom PCBs, and code for the microcontrollers used in this 
project.
